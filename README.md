# Facial-Recognition

Face Recognition Model using OpenCV and Deep Learning. 
First Face detection was performed, Used a pre-trained Caffe deep learning model provided by OpenCV to detect faces. This model detects and localizes faces in an image.
After Detection face embeddings were extracted from each face using deep learning.The FaceNet deep learning model computes a 128-d embedding that quantifies the face itself. 
Trained a face recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize faces in both images and video streams with OpenCV.

Trained a face recognition model on the embeddings, and then finally recognize faces in both images and video streams with OpenCV.
